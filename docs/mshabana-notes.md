Initial project setup and scaffolding.

The project goal is to get a transparent chatbot that will show model procession through the model's attention mechanism and generated token embedding space.

The next iteration of this project is to see how our visualizations hold up with adversarial testing against the model. If all is good there, we will automate the process of adversarial testing using advanced techniques.
